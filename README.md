This project aims for a simple web page with a card-based layout wich will show some professional and - personal - educational information (as a resume) and some projects that have been uploaded to GitHub (as a portfolio).

The layout was given by Rocketseat through Figma, in the context of a challenge called "Portfolio". Below, you can find the Figma link.
